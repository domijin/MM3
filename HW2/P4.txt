Trapzoid method has the least CPU time cost. But the accuracy is linear to the number of points. It is good for 'monotonous' functions.
Simpson method eliminates the leading error term from the Trapzoid method by weighted average. It only introduces negligible steps but increases the accuracy by one order.
Gaussian method uses weight function to distribute evaluation points. The interval must be in the range of [-1,1] and no singularity exists. The accuracy increases dramaticlly as more nodes are adapted.
