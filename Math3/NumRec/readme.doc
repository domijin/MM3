Please read this document completely before attempting to use the
NUMERICAL RECIPES FORTRAN DISKETTE.  Your use of any programs on this
diskette constitutes acceptance of the terms of the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY,
which is given in full at the end of this document.

WHAT IS THIS DISKETTE?
     This diskette contains machine-readable FORTRAN subroutines from the
book "Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing" published by
Cambridge University Press (1985).  If you do not have the book, this
diskette will not be very useful to you, since the subroutine versions on
this diskette do not repeat the book's explanations or line-by-line program
comments.  Details on how to order the book and other items are given at
the end of this document.

WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ON THIS DISKETTE?
     All 202 subroutines listed in "Numerical Recipes: The Art of
Scientific Computing" are included as FORTRAN source code on this diskette. 
A complete listing of their titles is in the file NAMES.DOC on this
diskette. Also on this diskette are five assembly language programs (in
.ASM source code) for the bitwise functions IAND, IEOR, IOR, ISHFT, and
NOT; and an "intentionally poor" random number generator RAN.FOR for use
with the shuffling procedure described in Chapter 7 of "Numerical Recipes:
The Art of Scientific Computing."
     The five assembly language routines with .ASM extensions have been
included primarily for your inspection.  Since you may not have an
assembler at your disposal, we have assembled these for you and provided
the corresponding object files with .OBJ extensions for use.  These object
files are used in exactly the same way as object files produced by the
Fortran compiler.  If ever needed, they are included as arguments to the
linker along with the other object modules that will make up the program.

WHAT VERSION OF FORTRAN IS USED?
     The programs on this diskette are in that subset of ANSI standard
FORTRAN-77 that is implemented by Microsoft Corporation in Microsoft
FORTRAN, version 3.3.  No incompatibilities with the full FORTRAN-77
standard have been introduced, so the program versions on this diskette
should also run on any full implementation of the FORTRAN-77 standard.  For
compilers that deviate from the standard, minor modifications in the
programs are required.

HOW DO YOU ACCESS THE PROGRAMS?
     This diskette has two "hidden" subdirectories.  The subdirectory
\RECIPES contains the 202 subroutines, all with names of the format *.FOR,
while the subdirectory \MISC contains the six extra programs mentioned
above.  For example, if this diskette is in drive A:, you can copy the
subroutine BCUCOF to your working directory by the command
COPY A:\RECIPES\BCUCOF.FOR <enter>
where <enter> denotes the enter or return key.  If you want to copy all the
program files, e.g. to a hard disk, you can do this by the two commands
COPY A:\RECIPES\*.* <enter>
COPY A:\MISC\*.* <enter>
This will take some time, since the number of files is large.  Also note
that most hard disks have a minimum file block size of 4096 bytes.  Since
most of the files are much shorter than that, the programs on this diskette
will occupy substantially more space on a hard disk.  We recommend that you
create a backup copy of this diskette using the DISKCOPY command, then copy
individual programs to your working directory only as you need them.

WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU NEED HELP?
     If you believe that this diskette is defective in manufacture, return
it to the place of purchase for replacement, or contact Cambridge
University Press at the address given below.
     For technical questions or assistance, write to Numerical Recipes
Software, P.O. Box 243, Cambridge, MA  02238.  Please note, however, that
the programs on this diskette are sold "as is" (see DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
below).  The authors of NUMERICAL RECIPES are interested in receiving
reports of bugs, but they cannot guarantee to correct them on any fixed
schedule.  User satisfaction is important to authors and publisher,
however, so you should not hesitate to make your comments or problems
known.
